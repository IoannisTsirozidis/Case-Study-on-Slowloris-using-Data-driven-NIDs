# ABSTRACT

This thesis focuses on the conceptual framework of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, particularly the Slowloris attack and its characteristics. It introduces terminologies related to threat detection and countermeasures in modern network traffic environments. The researchâ€™s scope also includes the intrinsic characteristics of related DoS attacks and proposes data analysis techniques for their detection. Moreover, a Python implementation of a majority Isolation Forest model is proposed as a detection methodology for Slowloris attacks, which achieves an accuracy of 94.3% on a deliberately selected dataset. The thesis also explores visualization techniques for network traffic analysis to gain insights into Slowloris behavior and provides real-time simulation guides for launching a Slowloris attack from a local computer, resulting in a denial of service on the local Apache server.
